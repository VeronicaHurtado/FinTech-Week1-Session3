## About me

Hi there!

My name is Veronica. I am a Systems Engineer.
I am originally from Venezuela but I moved to Australia back in 2011.

## Career Goals

I am currently working as a Developer in CX at Officeworks. 
I would like to gain the skills to specialise in the FinTech sector.

## Why FinTech as a career path?

For the past year I have become interested in Finances and investment. Also, my current role is closely related to Payments, thus FinTech could help me get a better role at my current job :)
